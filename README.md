# Predicting House Prices

In order to showcase my data wrangling capabilities as well my understanding of what constitutes a robust data analytics flow, I decided to engage in a data science project which would entail cleaning a very messy dataset. I eventually encountered a dataset relating to house prices in the America city of Ames, Iowa. After getting the respective data in a state fit for modelling, I employed a battery of residual diagnostic tests to assess the data - it was clear that linear forms of modelling would prove unsuitable. I then decided to explore tree based modelling, namely random forest and extreme gradient boosting. These forms of modelling are much better at capturing non-linear patterns. I used both types of models to predict house prices, both models were tuned to produce optimal predictive performance.
